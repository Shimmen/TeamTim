The findbugs picture shows that the application has no bugs left.
In the lower left corner you can see that there are 4 bugs that are hidden, but those are "Dead bugs".
That means that they have been fixed and are merely there to show what bugs have been fixed in the past.

Worth mentioning might be that, technically, the entire project is not scanned, since that would mean including a lot of classes made
by Google which have a lot of bugs. Due to this, only the classes which we have created are included in the analysis.
